  Particle-based simulations require high compute performance and bandwidth to simulate realistic workloads at meaningful scales and resolution.
  The Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE), a dataflow architecture comprising 900,000 processing elements, presents an alternative acceleration opportunity to CPU/GPU approaches. 
  Its flat memory layout and high-speed fabric interconnect pose a distinct optimization challenge compared to conventional communication and hierarchical memory bottlenecks.
  While mesh-based simulation techniques are efficient, they struggle to capture dynamic phenomena such as turbulent, free-surface and multiphase flows.
  This is where particle methods offer superior physical realism, but at an inherently steep cost of tracking individual particles and interactions with their neighbors as they flow freely through space.
  The tension between the target application of dynamic, unstructured particle flows and the target architecture of the WSE's structured grid requires strategic architectural mapping.
  We leverage a spatial parallelization approach to translate physical space to the architecture of the WSE and transcend the constraints of 1:1 element-PE mappings. 
  Dynamic and flexible routing of particles across this spatial domain, combined with support for variable particle populations per PE enables us to handle rapid, turbulent and high-velocity particle movement. 
  Our technique achieves exceptional performance and efficiency, showcasing significant potential to revolutionize particle-based simulations at the wafer scale.

\section{Introduction}
Particle flow methods have emerged as powerful techniques for modelling dynamic phenomena spanning multiple domains with high physical accuracy.
Meshfree, Lagrangian simulations allow precise motion tracking through continuous coordinate systems without lattice-imposed dicretization errors.
They offer inherent advatages over grid-based methods in handling complex geometries and high-velocity or free surface flows.
By intrinsically capturing motion at the mesoscopic scale, they avoid surface approximations that can compromise accuracy in grid-based approaches.

The computational intensity and high bandwidth requirements of Lagrangian simulations at realistic scales present formidable challenges for conventional architectures.
The modelling of large volumes of interacting particles over many timesteps demands high throughput and efficient, irregular memory accesses.
In high-motion environments, neighbour lists change rapidly and unpredictably. 
This naturally exerts strain on memory bandwidth and generally requires dynamic, coordinate-based sorting of particles into bins to streamline the search process.

Dataflow accelerators represent a paradigm shift in computer architecture.
The massive parallelism, high bandwidth and rapid fabric interconnect of the WSE make it a promising candidate for acceleration of certain algorithms.
Such algorithms must exploit the tradeoffs between these strengths and its rigid lattice architecture, data locality requirements and absence of shared memory.
We demonstrate the compatibility of Lagrangian simulations with this inherently spatial architecture by exploiting the proximity of neighbor data.
This expedites neighbor search, eliminating the sorting overhead of GPU implementations.

We present a dynamic and flexible Lagrangian system for the WSE, capable of efficient neighborhood search, interactions and dynamic spatial redistribution of particles. 
We introduce a flexible communication scheme which supports runtime-determined routes for variable numbers of particles. 
By overcoming the constraints of fixed element-to-PE mappings of prior works, we introduce a dynamic alternative. 
This work lays the foundation for deployment of practical Lagrangian applications at the wafer scale. 
We anticipate this will broaden the scope of algorithms that can be supported on the WSE, particularly simulations of dynamic, spatially-driven interactions - from fluid dynamics to molecular dynamics, crowd modelling, swarm behaviour and boid simulations. 

Our contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A scalable Lagrangian simulation framework on the WSE, presenting particle dynamics with soft sphere repulsive interactions as a representative use case.
	\item Spatial mapping of a global coordinate domain onto the WSE, with PE-local coordinate subdomains, allowing modelling of continuous particle flows.
	\item Many-to-one particle-to-PE mappings, enabling processing of multiple particles per PE.
	\item A dynamic and flexible routing scheme, enabling communication of variable-length particle data between dynamically-determined source and destination PEs.
	\item An efficient neighborhood search implementation which leverages the spatial proximity of nearby particles to identify all neighbors within a cutoff radius.
  \item Analysis of performance, efficiency and scalability, achieving superior results to state-of-the-art GPU approaches and simulating more particles than previous works.
\end{itemize}
